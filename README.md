# Java Basics

As a new developer, I have learnt a lot from the web and I found myself searching a lot online.
With this in mind, I thought of new developers learning online, so I wanted to share the small pieces of code that helped me learn and understand Java better. 

This are either short exercises or games that will help you understand better Java.

The files are just the code for you to implement in your own project.
I have NOT uploaded full projects with packages, dependencies, classes, etc. 

I hope these files help you :)
