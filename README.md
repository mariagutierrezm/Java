# Java Basics

As a new developer, I learnt a lot from the web and I tend to found myself searching a lot online.

With this in mind, I thought of new developers learning online, so I wanted to share the small pieces of code that helped me learn and understand Java better. 

These are either short exercises or games that will help you understand the language.

The files are just the code for you to implement in your own project/class files.
I have NOT uploaded full projects with packages/dependencies/classes, etc. 

I hope these files help you :)
